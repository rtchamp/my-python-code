# Hybrid Property ORM Example

This directory demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM with a hybrid property for querying.

## Files

- `orm.py`: Defines the `User` model with a hybrid property `full_name`.
- `main.py`: Shows how to create the database, insert data, and query using the hybrid property.

## Example

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will see the user id and full name for users matching the query.
